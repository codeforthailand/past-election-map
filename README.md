# Past Election Map for Thailand

### What is this about?

**ELECT**'s mission is to make politics more accessible for Thai people. With **Past Election Map**, we want to show information in the geo-political area. The goals are to display:

- How vote zone visually changes, e.g. any [gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering) ongoing?
- How power wrangling between parties evolves, both provincially and regionally.
- How well candidates run campaigns over several elections.
